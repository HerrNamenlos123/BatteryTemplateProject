# BatteryTemplateProject

This is a template to be used for the https://github.com/HerrNamenlos123/BatteryEngine

## Requirements

 - [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - For cloning, obviously
 - [Microsoft Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/) - Other IDEs can be used by altering `generate-win.bat`
 - [BatteryEngine](https://github.com/HerrNamenlos123/BatteryEngine) -> Must be compiled and installed before continuing

## How to use

 - Open a command prompt within the target directory: `git clone https://github.com/HerrNamenlos123/BatteryTemplateProject.git .`
 - Optionally: Use the green button to generate your derived repository and then clone that instead
 - Doubleclick `generate-win.bat`, enter a project name and start developing :P
 - BUT: Make sure not to commit back into this repo as this is a template!

Additionally:
When files are added, simply re-run `generate-win.bat` to add them to the Solution explorer.
